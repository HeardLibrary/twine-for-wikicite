**DEMO: How to create a new item for a publisher**

Verify if the publisher already exists in WikiData. The spelling of the publisher&#39;s name can be an issue. To avoid this issue, look for variants of the publisher&#39;s name. For example, &quot;and&quot; can be substituted by &quot;&amp;&quot;, ampersand. (link to tips for searching Wikidata)

Click &quot;create new item&quot; on the left-handed column under the WikiData logo.

Pick the language and enter the publisher&#39;s name in the **language label** field. Add the name in multiple languages if applicable. Name variants can be listed in the **aliases** field.
