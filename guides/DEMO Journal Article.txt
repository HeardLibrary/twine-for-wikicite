**DEMO: How to create a new item for a journal article**

Make sure the journal article doesn&#39;t already exist in WikiData. (link to tips for searching Wikidata)

Click on **Create a new item** on the left-handed column under the WikiData logo.

Pick the language and enter the journal title in the **language**** label** field.

In the **Description** field, use &quot;academic journal article&quot;, &quot;scientific journal article&quot;, &quot;newspaper article&quot;, or other options that reflect the nature of the article.

Click the **Create** button to create the item.

On the **statements** page, use as many of the following properties as possible. Use the **edit** button to make changes to what you&#39;ve added and **publish** your changes as you go along.

- instance of

In the property **instance of** , use &quot;scholarly article&quot;, &quot;academic article&quot;, &quot;review article&quot;, etc.

- Title/language of work and name

Add a language tag with the title after the title is entered. This property is correlated with **language of work and name**. If the article is written in multiple languages, list the languages with **language of work and name**.

- author(s)/author name string

Use QID in the property **author(s)**. If no QID, create a new item for the author or use **author name string**. Include **series ordinal** as a qualifier if the article is co-authored.

- published in

Include the journal title in the property **published in**.

- List **publication date** , **volume** , **issue** , **page(s)**, and **main subject** in the corelated properties.

On the page of **identifier** ,List the DOI, PM ID and/or PMC ID if they are available.

- DOI

The most commonly used identifier for journal articles is DOI. DOI can be retrieved from CrossRef.org. Use the &quot;[search metadata](https://search.crossref.org/?from_ui=yes&amp;q=metadata)&quot; option.

- PM ID
- PMC ID

In the biomedical fields, PubMed ID and PMC ID are well-accepted. PMC ID and PubMed ID are not the same. You can look up a PubMed ID (PM ID) by searching journal title in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). You can conduct a journal title search in [europepmc.org](https://europepmc.org/) to retrieve PMC ID.
