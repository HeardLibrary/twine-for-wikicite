DEMO: INTRODUCTION TO LINKED DATA [2nd lesson – Follows course intro]

Almost everything in Wikidata is linked to something else. If an item has a main subject, you can click on that subject to see all other items with the same subject. If you want to see what is linked to the item that you&#39;re looking at, click &quot;what links here&quot; on the left side of the screen.

Data is stored in semantic triples, or simply &quot;triples&quot; – sets of three entities that form a subject—verb—object relationship. Any data in this relationship can be accessed directly by the user. In this example, you could click on the verb &quot;doctoral student&quot; to find more information about how to use this category.

Every data repository comprises three units: item, statement, and identifier. An item consists of a label, a description, and any applicable aliases. A statement describes the characteristics of the item with a list of properties and values. And an identifier indicates the item is linked to the external database for authority records, such as OCLC control number or ISBN. (including the diagram of a WikiData item from the link below?)

The hard part of entering a new item is that almost all data that you enter must be linkable to some item already in Wikidata. For instance, if you&#39;re entering a journal article, you can only enter journals which already have Wikidata items. (Most major journals already have items.) The solution is to create a new item for the journal title that you need, which we will show you how to do later. [Twine -- Link to how to create a periodical title]

If you see a property that you have doubts about how to use, you can click on that property to see a definition and examples of how it is used. For example, if you click on the property &quot;publisher&quot; (Q123), you will see some examples of its usage and related properties which could be a closer match to your needs.

If you&#39;ve never worked with linked data before, don&#39;t worry, with a little experience it will start to (mostly) feel familiar.
