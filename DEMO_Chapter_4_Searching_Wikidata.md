DEMO: CHECKING FOR DUPLICATES IN WIKIDATA (Chapter 4)

Wikidata searching is idiosyncratic.

Missing initials or periods will throw off the search. [Twine – link to author record creation]

Example: If you get &quot;No match was found,&quot; be sure to click on the box with the word &quot;containing…&quot;

Be sure to check any articles or books that come up in the search – your subject might appear as an author string. You should record that author string and enter it as an alias when you create the record. This will help others who follow – the search box also searches aliases. Knowing aliases will also help you later with author disambiguation [Twine – Link to author disambiguation]

Example for Pietro Castelnuovo-Tedesco (Q7178862)

If you still can&#39;t find an author that you believe should be in Wikidata, check your university&#39;s faculty homepages to see what names your subject typically uses. Many faculty will list citations on their homepages which can provide some aliases.
