**DEMO: How to create a new item for an author**

Wikipedia is a helpful resource to find the needed information to create a new item for an author. If the author&#39;s name is not found in Wikipedia, obtaining an author&#39;s CV can be an effective solution.

Make sure the person&#39;s name doesn&#39;t already exist in Wikidata. (link to tips for searching Wikidata)

Click &quot;create new item&quot; on the left-handed column under the WikiData logo.

Pick the language and enter the author&#39;s name in the **language label** field. Add the name in multiple languages if applicable. Name variants can be listed in **aliases** field.

Assign an appropriate **description** to the author. The description can be author&#39;s job title with the specification of his/her academic or research field.

Click the **Create** button to create the item.

On the **statements** page, use as many of the following properties as possible. Use the **edit** button to make changes to what you&#39;ve added and p **ublish** your changes as you go along.

**Instance of** for an author should be &quot;human.&quot;

On the **identifier** page, list the VIAF (Virtual International Authority File), ORCID ID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), and/or LCNAF (Library of Congress Name Authority File).

VIAF, LCNAF, and ORCID are the most common used identifiers for the author record. These identifiers can be retrieved from their websites.
