DEMO: INTRODUCTION TO OUR WIKIDATA COURSE

Welcome to WikiCite for Librarians, launched by staff at Vanderbilt University Libraries in Nashville, Tennessee USA (and hopefully added to by worldwide contributors).

[Maybe show a slide with the info below instead of reading it all]

What is Wikidata?

--Wikidata is an online open-source database which is collaboratively edited – anyone can edit.

--It uses a linked data structure and includes references to verify data.

--It is used as a data source for Wikimedia projects. For example, in 2018, 64% of Wikipedia pages show data from Wikidata. An early project of Wikidata was to centralize interlanguage links for Wikipedia.

--Wikidata is multilingual and multicultural.

--It is a data source for anyone to use.

How can Wikidata benefit your institution?

Your team can help elevate the research profile of your institution. For example, at Vanderbilt, part of our team specialized in humanities scholars whose work had not been picked up by the major publication databases. The major databases tend to concentrate on engineering and sciences. The faculty publications entered by our teamare now linked to their subjects and our university in Wikidata.

Linked data is increasingly important in information organization. By working with Wikidata, your library&#39;s staff will become familiar with the organization, use, and difficulties of linked data. In our library, many specialists from the director, to administrative staff, to assistants have worked together on our WikiCite project.

There is a low barrier to entry to editing Wikidata – All you need is a PC, internet connection, and training like this one. Most of our team self-trained after a brief introductory video, but we believe that an interactive course like ours will reduce some of the frustration that we felt.

This interactive course is made up of short video segments. You can navigate directly to videos that are of interest to you using our Twine navigation map. [Edit here with specifics when the Twine is developed.]

[Approximately 2:30 to read aloud]
