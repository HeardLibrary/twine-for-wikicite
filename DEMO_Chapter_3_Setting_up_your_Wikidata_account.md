DEMO: SETTING UP A WIKIDATA ACCOUNT [3rd lesson – Follows intro to linked data]

To start your account, click the &quot;Log in&quot; tab in the upper right of any Wikidata page. Look to the bottom of the page and click the &quot;Join Wikidata&quot; button.

Choose a username --- you can use your name or a nickname. Choose a password.

Afterwards, when you&#39;re logged in, your username will appear in a tab at the top of every Wikidata page that you visit.

SHOW HOW TO USE THE EDIT BOX

There is an edit tab at the top of your user page.

Just type in the window. There is a help tab at the top of the edit window which shows how to make headings and other types of special text and links.

SHOW HOW AND WHY TO WRITE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT

If you&#39;re editing for your employer, you should disclose this on your user page in a conflict of interest statement. It&#39;s fine to edit where you have a conflict of interest, but there are few behaviors that you should be careful about. See this discussion page:

https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Requests\_for\_comment/Conflict\_of\_Interest

SHOW HOW TO SET UP A BABEL LANGUAGE BOX

Set up a Babel language box to have Wikidata show you labels from more languages in the main namespace which includes main labels and aliases. You can indicate your level of fluency on a scale of zero to five. If you&#39;re just starting to learn a language, you can put your level as zero and it might help you learn some new terms. Your Babel settings will not affect the primary language display for Wikidata labels that you can change at the top of every page of Wikidata.

A Babel template has this general form: {{#babel:da-0|de-1|en-2|es-3|fr-4|it-5|pl-n}}

You can find Babel templates to cut, paste and edit at [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Userboxes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Userboxes)

The ISO language codes may be found on Wikipedia.

SHOW HOW TO JOIN A WIKIPROJECT

WikiProjects help editors who have a common interest stay in touch. As you start editing, you will see that some pages are on the focus lists of WikiProjects.

Again, see the Wikidata userboxes page on how to join a WikiProject and receive notices from the project. [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Userboxes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Userboxes)
